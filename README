The 'rvanal' package deals with statistical tests of sinusoid fits,
with radial velocity curves of circular orbits particularly in
mind. The sorts of things it does are to determine the best period, to
plot out the best period and competeing aliases, etc. It can also help
with optimising placement of observations.

Read the file INSTALL for installation instructions.
