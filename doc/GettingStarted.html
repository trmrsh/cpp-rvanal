<h1>Getting started with the radial velocity analysis software</h1>

<p>
This page attempts to give you an idea of how to get going with the software,
without going into extensive details. Follow the links for further information.

<p>
Suppose you are observing, and have a few radial velocity measurements in the bag
on a particular star. You need to have them in a little file listing the time 
(strictly HJD, but JD would be OK for longish orbital periods), the radial velocity
and a 1 sigma uncertainty estimate. e.g it might loook like this
<pre>
#
# RV data on an interesting target
#
2450016.76512 -123.5 1.4
2450017.78058  56.9  2.5
2450018.72001 -43.1  2.1
2450018.83101 -15.1  2.0
</pre>

<p>
At this point, your target is clearly a binary star, and you want to know (a) what periods
are possible, but, more importantly, (b) when should I observe to best discriminate between
the possible aliases?

<p>
The program you want to use is <a href="aliases.html">aliases</a>. This can be run with
or without plotting. Assuming you have run the script to define the (computer) aliases, 
just type 'aliases' and it will prompt you. Look at the on-line help for details of the
arguments. Without plotting, it just lists the best periods over a specified range
of frequencies (it searches a uniform grid of frequency). With plotting, it also requires
the name of a file with positional data on stars and the name of the star you are interested
in. For example:
<pre>
Star 1
19 23 34.0 -23 04 51.0 2000

Star 2
21 02 34.0 +45 56 12.0 2000

</pre>
It always assumes J2000 coords; the 2000 at the end just means the
date of the equinox to precess to. Its very picky; you must give it
<strong>exactly</strong> the right name, including case, e.g. "Star
2". You also need to specify a date; its not that flexible about the
date format, so copy the format of the suggested value.

<p>
You will then get a plot of velocity versus time for the night in question, with the predicted
path of each alias. It will also plot any data for that night (quite often none if you are predicting
ahead of time). Its up to you to decide when is best to observe at this point, but clearly
the times where the predictions differ most are the ones to go for. Before you take this plot
too seriously, take a look at the predicted uncertainty in phase. If this is huge, then you
should not take the plot seriously, or worry too much about when to observe. Once the phase
uncertainty becomes small however, then this optimisation of times can be very useful.

<p>
Another command you may find useful is <a href="pgram.html">pgram</a> to plot a periodogram
(although note that it plots Chi**2 so the "troughs" are the good periods ... this is because then
one does not have to fiddle around with the vertical axis limits to zoom in vertically on a 
good peak). Finally, <a href="pfold.html">pfold</a> plots a phase-folded radial velocity curve.
Always remember that the best period almost always looks good when phase-folded, but this does not
always mean that it is in fact correct.

<p>
Note that all commands can be run on the command-line, as in 
<pre>
aliases junk 0.01 20 20 30 0.01 1.4 2 yes /xs "19 Jan 2003" WHT stars.dat "Star 1"
</pre>
Arguments with spaces have to be quoted to be treated as single arguments. I have simulated
the command-line behaviour of STARLINK commands so you could next time say
<pre>
aliases data=junk fhigh=30 fmax=2 \\
</pre>
which just changes the specified arguments and uses the old values for the rest.

<p>
Good luck and let me know of problems.
